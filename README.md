Build a responsive website using only HTML, CSS and JS.

It would be the site for my "resume" just with my name and a little bio, a list of courses I completed and a list of projects.
In my resume, I will put:
- some information about my studies with the possibility to be clicked redirecting somewhere;

- each course should have:

    - name

    - little description

    - progress [%]

- each project sould have:
    - name

    - little description

    - technologies used (maybe with icons)

    - list of pictures path

    - pdf file path
    
    - link to github page

I will read those lists from a json file in an autonomous way.

I would like it to have both dark and light themes.
